# call-log-portal
**Summary:**
Web application built with ASP.Net &amp; C# to fetch and display call SIP call data.

## Description
While studying at university, I worked with a local telecomatics company who specialise in SIP technologies to develop a interactive web application which allows their customers to view, fitler and export their call data.

### Techologies
The application was built using ASP.Net, C# and JavaScript. SSH.Net and Bootstrap 4 has also been used to speed up development time. The call data is retrieved via SFTP and converted into the correct format using Regex to then store locally in an MS SQL database.
